# NOTES

Pros:
- Everything with the editor was very nice to use.
- Component system is a must; more organise than BabylonJS.
- Making UI is simple
- Asset Management within the Editor is simple
- C# is nice, API can be less wordy than Babylonjs

Cons:
- API is a mess and "advanced" functions are hard to use and buggy,
  > you feel like you are hacking your way to make your game instead of programming a game 
  > Example 1: MergeMeshes() will take you 15 lines of code, that you will have copy-pasted from official example, cause you would have no idea how to use it otherwise. And still, it won't work properly, and do not manage the textures/materials. In BabylonJS, just take 1 line.
  > Example 2: HLAPI for UNet is a living joke; wasted 3 months of my life trying to use it.
- Asset Management in Script is a nightmare
- many ways to do one thing but no way to do it well
- says that WebGL mobile is not supported
- compile to webGL is loooooo000000ong
